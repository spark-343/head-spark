# home-spark
A smart cube that displays your notifications in the most suitable ways everywhere in your home.

For now the cube works only if you are online.

In the final version, **home-spark** will be composed of:

* 1 arduino for the hardware interface
* 1 raspberry pi 3 for the online interface and the computing power

Maybe only arduino will be necessary if all the computing is transfered online.

For development raspberry pi can be replaced by a computer.

## Setup the Apis

* create the file .env
* add your api keys in the file .env

See more on the file .env_example
